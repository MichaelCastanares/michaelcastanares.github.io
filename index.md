### Research Initiatives: Use of alternative datasets to nowcast the Philippine economy

[Nowcasting Philippine Household Consumption: An Alternative
Approach using Google Trends and XGBoost Model](/sample_page)

**Abstract.** This study aims to develop a model for nowcasting household consumption in the Philippines using alternative data and machine learning model. In particular, we utilize Google search queries and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to nowcast household consumption. Our results indicate that XGBoost model outperforms benchmark autoregressive models. Shapley Additive explanations suggest that the top features of the XGBoost model are lags of household consumption and Google searches related to travel. Overall, we demonstrate the potential use of Google Trends in capturing the likely trends in household spending in the near term.

[A Machine Learning Approach to Constructing A Weekly GDP Tracker using Google Trends](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

**Abstract.** High frequency and granular data are integral in crafting prompt and appropriate measures toward mitigating impact of economic headwinds. We construct a near real-time Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth tracker that capitalizes on available high frequency alternative data and state-of-the-art machine learning models. The tracker serves as a complementary surveillance tool for monitoring economic activity. <a href = "https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Media_And_Research/Publications/EN23-02.pdf"> Link to paper </a>
