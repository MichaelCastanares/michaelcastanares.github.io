["Challenges on the use of Google Trends for research"](/Entry_GT)

*Updated: 1 February 2026*

Internet search volumes (Google Trends) have become popular proxies for estimating current period (also referred to as "nowcasting") macroeconomic indicators. In my work on machine learning models, I've seen firsthand how these high-frequency indicators (GT variables) can circumvent the publication lags of official statistics.

However, there is a trade-off. GT variables suffer from temporal 
instability, backend scaling issues, and time-varying relevance—challenges 
that can quietly undermine model performance if left unaddressed. In this blog, I highlight some potential pros and cons on the use of Internet searches (Google Trends) for research, drawing from my work on machine learning nowcasting models.
